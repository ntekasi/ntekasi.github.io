      Spatial RNA-seq · Host-Microbiome · Non-coding RNA</p>

      <p><strong>I work at the intersection of spatial transcriptomics and systems biology, developing technologies that extend the capabilities of spatial RNA sequencing beyond protein-coding transcripts.</strong> Spatial transcriptomics is a transformative approach that preserves the spatial organization of tissues while capturing gene expression—an advancement that holds great promise for enhancing diagnostic biopsies and understanding tissue function at unprecedented resolution.</p>

      <p>My research focuses on broadening the molecular scope of this technology to include non-coding RNAs and non-host transcripts, such as those of microbial origin, which are typically underrepresented in standard protocols. By doing so, I aim to unlock new biological insights from both the host and its surrounding microenvironment. Applications of this expanded framework include spatially resolved microbiome mapping—capturing the organization of microbial communities in situ alongside neighboring host cell states—as well as profiling transcriptomic architecture in the reproductive system, where spatial cues are tightly linked to function and development.</p>
